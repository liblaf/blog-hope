This means you need permission from the copyright holder to use the image unless an exception applies.</li><li><strong>Licensing Agreements</strong>: Many online databases provide images under specific licenses (e.g., Creative Commons, GNU Free Documentation License). These licenses often specify how the images can be used, modified, and shared. Always check the license terms before using an image.</li></ul><h3 id="_2-fair-use-fair-dealing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-fair-use-fair-dealing"><span>2. <strong>Fair Use/Fair Dealing</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Fair Use (U.S.)</strong>: In the United States, the “fair use” doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Factors considered include: <ul><li>The purpose and character of the use (e.g., commercial vs. educational).</li><li>The nature of the copyrighted work.</li><li>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.</li><li>The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fair Dealing (Canada)</strong>: Similar to fair use, fair dealing in Canada allows limited use of copyrighted material for purposes such as research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review, and news reporting.</li><li><strong>Other Jurisdictions</strong>: Many countries have similar exceptions, often referred to as “fair dealing” or “fair use,” but the specifics can vary.</li></ul><h3 id="_3-educational-exceptions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-educational-exceptions"><span>3. <strong>Educational Exceptions</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Educational Use</strong>: Many countries have specific exceptions for educational use. For example, in the U.S., educational institutions may have broader fair use rights. In the EU, the “educational exception” under Article 5 of the InfoSoc Directive allows limited use of copyrighted works for educational purposes.</li><li><strong>Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some licenses and exceptions specifically allow non-commercial use of images in academic presentations.</li></ul><h3 id="_4-attribution-requirements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-attribution-requirements"><span>4. <strong>Attribution Requirements</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Proper Attribution</strong>: Even if you are using an image under fair use or an educational exception, you may still need to provide proper attribution to the creator. This is often required by licenses like Creative Commons.</li><li><strong>Citation</strong>: Include the source, author, and any relevant license information in your presentation or accompanying materials.</li></ul><h3 id="_5-modifying-images" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-modifying-images"><span>5. <strong>Modifying Images</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>License Restrictions</strong>: Some licenses allow modification, while others do not. Always check the license terms before modifying an image.</li><li><strong>Derivative Works</strong>: If you modify an image, you may be creating a derivative work. Ensure that the original license permits this and that you comply with any additional requirements (e.g., sharing the modified image under the same license).</li></ul><h3 id="_6-public-domain-and-open-access" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-public-domain-and-open-access"><span>6. <strong>Public Domain and Open Access</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Public Domain</strong>: Images in the public domain are not protected by copyright and can be used freely.</li><li><strong>Open Access</strong>: Some images are available under open access licenses that allow free use, modification, and distribution, often with attribution.</li></ul><h3 id="_7-international-considerations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-international-considerations"><span>7. <strong>International Considerations</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Cross-Border Use</strong>: Be aware that copyright laws vary by country. If your presentation will be shared internationally, ensure compliance with the laws of each relevant jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>WIPO Treaties</strong>: The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) provides international treaties that guide copyright law, but implementation can vary by country.</li></ul><h3 id="_8-best-practices" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-best-practices"><span>8. <strong>Best Practices</strong></span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Use Licensed Images</strong>: Whenever possible, use images that come with clear licenses that allow your intended use.</li><li><strong>Seek Permission</strong>: If in doubt, seek permission from the copyright holder.</li><li><strong>Document Sources</strong>: Keep records of where you obtained images and the terms under which they were used.</li></ul><h2 id="chat-with-iask" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chat-with-iask"><span>Chat with iAsk</span></a></h2><h3 id="user" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#user"><span>User</span></a></h3><p>How should copyright be respected when using online images?</p><h3 id="提问引导师" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#提问引导师"><span>提问引导师</span></a></h3><p>That’s an important question about respecting copyright when using online images.
